//brute force: sort, linearly itterate and see, which merges, and take another data structure and store 1st and 2nd of each element
// O(nlogn)+O(n^2)

//sort it, and store the first element in a pair, and check merging and add them in the data structure while chanign the pair value
//O(nlogn)+O(n)
